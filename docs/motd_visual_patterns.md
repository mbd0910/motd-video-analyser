## Visual Patterns by Type

### 1. Intro Sequence
**Visual characteristics:**
- [Describe what the intro looks like]
- Very distinctive music: we could definitely identify the end of the intro based on the end of the MOTD theme song.

**Duration:** 49 seconds. Typically consistent across episodes, but could be rare edge cases I imagine.

**Auto-extracted frames showing intro:**
- scene_001.jpg - 
- scene_120.jpg - Liverpool team lifting last season's Premier League
- scene_121.jpg - logos start spinning around
- scene_122.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_123.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_124.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_125.jpg - host on screen: end of intro


**Notes for OCR:**
- This intro sequence will be identical week-to-week, but there's a possibility that this could be played before or after some other footage should there be something major happening in the football world or in current affairs.

---

### 2. Teams walking out and warming up
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Entire screen
- This can vary - very dependent on match order (first game might show teams coming out of a tunnel, later games might immediately show players on the pitch)
- There will always be some sort of pre-match visualisation between the host's introduction. (from the studio) and the actual footage of the game starting - players walking out of the tunnel or players warming up.

---

### 3a. Whole Screen Formation Graphics
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Spanning almost entire screen
- **Text colour:** [e.g., white, yellow]
- **Background:** Yellow
- **Font style:** BBC Sport Font
- **Additional elements:** Club names, club badge, head coach, player headshots, recent form, substitutes list

**When they appear:**
- [e.g., at start of match highlights during team walkout]
- [e.g., before kickoff]
- **Typical duration visible:** ~X seconds

**Auto-extracted frames showing formation graphics:**
- scene_XXX.jpg - FAILED TO CAPTURE IN PREVIOUS EPIC

**Text examples visible in graphics:**
- [e.g., "BRIGHTON & HOVE ALBION" or "Brighton" or "BRIGHTON"]
- [e.g., "LEEDS UNITED" or "Leeds" or "LEEDS"]
- [Note any abbreviations or variations used]

**Notes for OCR:**
- These are the HIGHEST QUALITY frames for team detection
- Text is static, clear, well-call rightontrasted
- Should prioritise these frames over scoreboard graphics

**Manual screenshot**

### 3b. Bottom of screen formation graphics

Other games get this lesser treatment, with lineups just being shown at the bottom of the screen

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Bottom third of the screen
- **Text colour:** Black
- **Background:** Yellow
- **Font style:** BBC Sport Font
- **Additional elements:** Formation visualisation in bottom right

**When they appear:**
- From 2nd match onwards. Once we've gone from the studio to the first half highlights.

**Auto-extracted frames showing formation graphics:**
- scene_243.jpg
- scene_246.jpg
- scene_247.jpg
- scene_439.jpg
- scene_644.jpg

These were not captured automatically for match 3
Only captured for Wolves (not Fulham) in match 4
Neither captured automatically for match 5
Brighton's partially captured in match 6

### 5. Second half indicator

This isn't always captured perfectly in the auto-extracted frames, but there are hopefully enough examples provided and a manual screenshot. It's the classic transition graphic with "SECOND HALF" in huge white text super-imposed on top.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Whole screen

### 6. Full Time Score graphics

This is a great indicator that the second half highlights are about to end and we'll be transitioning into the interview segment. Not always currently captured by our auto-extracted frames.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Lower middle of screen
- **Text colour:** Black
- **Background:** Yellow top left, white towards bottom gradient, top right shows Premier League symbol and colours

- docs/screenshots/spurs_chelsea_ft_score.png
- docs/screenshots/brighton_leeds_ft_score.png

---

### 7. Post match interview examples

Generally a single person (sometimes players interviewed together or with a translator as well, but much more rare) being interviewed. Can be interspersed with footage from the game showing what they're being questioned about, so the key thing is identifying the transition back to the studio after the interviews. When a new person is interviewed, their name and team is displayed in the bottom left corner.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Whole screen
- **Text colour:** N/A
- **Background:** Player/managers generally stand in front of a board showing lots of sponsors (company logoes!)
- **Font style:** N/A
- **Additional elements:** When a new player or manager is interviewed, their name is displayed in a box in the bottom left hand corner. If we cut to another player and back to a player we've already heard from, we don't show their name again. We've got very few examples of these in the auto-extracted frames.

**Auto-extracted frames**
- scene_228.jpg
- scene_229.jpg
- scene_233.jpg
- scene_316.jpg
- scene_407.jpg

### 3. Scoreboard Graphics
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** [e.g., top-left corner]
- **Text colour:** [e.g., white on dark background]
- **Background:** [e.g., BBC Sport red bar, semi-transparent]
- **Additional elements:** [e.g., score, match time, BBC Sport logo]

**When they appear:**
- [e.g., during match highlights, constantly visible]
- [e.g., updated when goals scored]

**Auto-extracted frames showing scoreboard graphics:**
- scene_XXX.jpg - [Team A] vs [Team B] scoreboard (timestamp XX:XX:XX)
- scene_XXX.jpg - [example during play]
- scene_XXX.jpg - [example with different teams]

**Text examples visible in scoreboards:**
- [e.g., "Brighton 2-0 Leeds" or "BHA 2 LEE 0"]
- [Note any abbreviations used]

**Notes for OCR:**
- Lower quality than formation graphics (often motion-blurred)
- May be partially obscured by on-screen graphics or player overlays
- Use as secondary source if formation graphics not available
- OCR region should be [specific coordinates/area]

---

### 4. Studio Segments
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Layout:** [e.g., presenters at desk, analysis screens behind]
- **Colour palette:** [e.g., dark blue set, BBC Sport branding]
- **Typical presenters:** [e.g., Gary Lineker, pundits]

**When they appear:**
- [e.g., between matches, post-match analysis]
- **Typical duration:** ~X-XX minutes

**Auto-extracted frames showing studio:**
- scene_XXX.jpg - [description, e.g., presenter intro]
- scene_XXX.jpg - [post-match discussion]

**Notes for OCR:**
- NO team graphics visible (skip these frames for OCR)
- Can identify studio segments by [colour palette, layout, etc.]
- Could filter out before OCR to save processing time

---

### 5. Transition Patterns
**How MOTD transitions between segments:**

This is the most regular transition used. "SECOND HALF" text is superimposed on top to indicate the teams swapping ends and the second half starting.

**Auto-extracted frames**
- scene_222.jpg
- scene_250.jpg
- scene_251.jpg
- scene_313.jpg
- scene_314.jpg
- scene_333.jpg
- scene_404.jpg
- scene_405.jpg
- scene_406.jpg
- scene_440.jpg
- scene_441.jpg
- scene_442.jpg
- scene_502.jpg
- scene_503.jpg
- scene_504.jpg
- scene_651.jpg
- scene_686.jpg
- scene_687.jpg

**Manual screenshot**
- docs/screenshots/transition_graphics.png

**Interviews -> Studio:**

There doesn't seem to be a transition animation used here. We normally get a zoomed out view of the hosts and pundits in the studio, flanked/accompanied by graphics of a couple of key players who featured in the game.

**Auto-extracted frames**

- Match 1: scene_234.jpg
- Match 2: scene_320.jpg
- Match 3: scene_419.jpg
- Match 4: scene_517.jpg
- Match 5: scene_630.jpg
- Match 6: scene_690.jpg

**VAR During highlights**

This shouldn't be identified as a transition per se, but here are some examples.

**Auto-extracted frames**

- scene_451.jpg
- scene_452.jpg
- scene_453.jpg
- scene_454.jpg
- scene_455.jpg
- scene_456.jpg
- scene_457.jpg
- scene_458.jpg

**Match Highlights Internal Structure:**
1. [e.g., Team walkout with formation graphic]
2. [e.g., Kickoff]
3. [e.g., Match action with scoreboard]
4. [e.g., Goals/key moments]
5. [e.g., Full-time whistle]

**Notes for OCR:**
- Transitions help identify segment boundaries
- Formation graphics typically appear at [specific point in match sequence]
- Can use transition detection to find formation graphics more efficiently

## OCR Implementation Recommendations

### Priority 1: Formation Graphics (Highest Accuracy)
- **Target frames:** [list scene numbers that show formation graphics]
- **Recommended OCR region:** [coordinates or description]
- **Expected accuracy:** >95% (text is clear and static)

### Priority 2: Scoreboard Graphics (Backup Method)
- **Target frames:** [during match highlights]
- **Recommended OCR region:** [coordinates or description]
- **Expected accuracy:** ~85-90% (motion blur, obscuring)

### Priority 3: Skip These Frames
- **Intro:** scene_XXX to scene_XXX (first ~XX seconds)
- **Studio:** [characteristics to identify studio frames]
- **Transitions:** [very short duration scenes, e.g., <1 second]

### Scene Filtering Strategy
Based on this reconnaissance, suggest filtering 810 scenes to ~XXX relevant scenes by:
1. Skip first ~XX scenes (intro)
2. Skip scenes with duration <X seconds (transitions)
3. Skip scenes that match studio visual pattern
4. Prioritise scenes around [timing when formation graphics appear]

**Estimated scenes for OCR after filtering:** ~XXX out of 810

## Manual Annotations (Optional)

If any critical patterns aren't captured in auto-extracted frames, add manual screenshots below:

### [Pattern Name]
![Manual screenshot](path/to/manual/screenshot.png)
- **Timestamp:** XX:XX:XX
- **Description:** [what this shows]
- **Why needed:** [why auto-extracted frames didn't capture this]

---

## Questions for OCR Implementation

After completing this reconnaissance, answer these questions for 009b-009g:

1. **Should we skip the intro entirely?** YES / NO
   - If YES, skip first XX seconds

2. **What's the best frame type for OCR?** Formation graphics / Scoreboards / Both
   - Justification: [based on your observations]

3. **Can we identify studio segments visually?** YES / NO
   - If YES, how? [colour palette, layout, etc.]

4. **Estimated % of 810 frames that are useful for OCR:** XX%
   - Filtering strategy: [describe approach]

5. **Any unexpected patterns discovered:**
   - [anything not anticipated in planning]
