## Visual Patterns by Type

### 1. Intro Sequence
**Visual characteristics:**
- [Describe what the intro looks like]
- Very distinctive music: we could definitely identify the end of the intro based on the end of the MOTD theme song.

**Duration:** 49 seconds. Typically consistent across episodes, but could be rare edge cases I imagine.

**Auto-extracted frames showing intro:**
- scene_001.jpg - 
- scene_120.jpg - Liverpool team lifting last season's Premier League
- scene_121.jpg - logos start spinning around
- scene_122.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_123.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_124.jpg - logos still spinning around
- scene_125.jpg - host on screen: end of intro


**Notes for OCR:**
- This intro sequence will be identical week-to-week, but there's a possibility that this could be played before or after some other footage should there be something major happening in the football world or in current affairs.

---

### 2. Teams walking out and warming up
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Entire screen
- This can vary - very dependent on match order (first game might show teams coming out of a tunnel, later games might immediately show players on the pitch)
- There will always be some sort of pre-match visualisation between the host's introduction. (from the studio) and the actual footage of the game starting - players walking out of the tunnel or players warming up.

---

### 3a. Whole Screen Formation Graphics
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Spanning almost entire screen
- **Text colour:** [e.g., white, yellow]
- **Background:** Yellow
- **Font style:** BBC Sport Font
- **Additional elements:** Club names, club badge, head coach, player headshots, recent form, substitutes list

**When they appear:**
- [e.g., at start of match highlights during team walkout]
- [e.g., before kickoff]
- **Typical duration visible:** ~X seconds

**Auto-extracted frames showing formation graphics:**
- scene_XXX.jpg - FAILED TO CAPTURE IN PREVIOUS EPIC

**Text examples visible in graphics:**
- [e.g., "BRIGHTON & HOVE ALBION" or "Brighton" or "BRIGHTON"]
- [e.g., "LEEDS UNITED" or "Leeds" or "LEEDS"]
- [Note any abbreviations or variations used]

**Notes for OCR:**
- These are the HIGHEST QUALITY frames for team detection
- Text is static, clear, well-call rightontrasted
- Should prioritise these frames over scoreboard graphics

**Manual screenshot**
- docs/screenshots/aston_villa_whole_screen_formation.png
- docs/screenshots/liverpool_whole_screen_formation.png

### 3b. Bottom of screen formation graphics

Other games get this lesser treatment, with lineups just being shown at the bottom of the screen

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Bottom third of the screen
- **Text colour:** Black
- **Background:** Yellow
- **Font style:** BBC Sport Font
- **Additional elements:** Formation visualisation in bottom right

**When they appear:**
- From 2nd match onwards. Once we've gone from the studio to the first half highlights.

**Auto-extracted frames showing formation graphics:**
- scene_243.jpg
- scene_246.jpg
- scene_247.jpg
- scene_439.jpg
- scene_644.jpg
- scene_645.jpg
- scene_647.jpg
- scene_648.jpg
- scene_649.jpg

These were not captured automatically for match 3
Only captured for Wolves (not Fulham) in match 4
Neither captured automatically for match 5
Brighton's partially captured in match 6

### 5. Second half indicator

This isn't always captured perfectly in the auto-extracted frames, but there are hopefully enough examples provided and a manual screenshot. It's the classic transition graphic with "SECOND HALF" in huge white text super-imposed on top.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Whole screen
- **Text colour:** White
- **Background:** N/A

- scene_667.jpg
- scene_729.jpg
- scene_730.jpg

**Manual screenshot**
- docs/screenshots/second_half.png

### 6. Full Time Score graphics

This is a great indicator that the second half highlights are about to end and we'll be transitioning into the interview segment. Not always currently captured by our auto-extracted frames.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Lower middle of screen
- **Text colour:** Black
- **Background:** Yellow top left, white towards bottom gradient, top right shows Premier League symbol and colours
- **Font style:** BBC sport font
- **Additional elements:** N/A

**Auto-extracted frames**

- scene_220.jpg
- scene_221.jpg
- scene_312.jpg
- scene_401.jpg

**Manual screenshot**

- docs/screenshots/palace_brentford_ft_score.png

---

### 7. Post match interview examples

Generally a single person (sometimes players interviewed together or with a translator as well, but much more rare) being interviewed. Can be interspersed with footage from the game showing what they're being questioned about, so the key thing is identifying the transition back to the studio after the interviews. When a new person is interviewed, their name and team is displayed in the bottom left corner.

**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Whole screen
- **Text colour:** N/A
- **Background:** Player/managers generally stand in front of a board showing lots of sponsors (company logoes!)
- **Font style:** N/A
- **Additional elements:** When a new player or manager is interviewed, their name is displayed in a box in the bottom left hand corner. If we cut to another player and back to a player we've already heard from, we don't show their name again. We've got very few examples of these in the auto-extracted frames.

**Auto-extracted frames**
- scene_228.jpg
- scene_229.jpg
- scene_233.jpg
- scene_316.jpg
- scene_407.jpg

### 8. Scoreboard Graphics (During Match Highlights)
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Location on screen:** Top left corner
- **Text colour:** Differs depending on background
- **Background:** Depends on colours of team shirts
- **Additional elements:** BBC Logo, team codes, scoreline, red card indicators

**When they appear:**
- [e.g., during match highlights, constantly visible]
- [e.g., updated when goals scored]

**Auto-extracted frames showing scoreboard graphics:**
- scene_154.jpg - Liverpool 0 Aston Villa 0
- scene_175.jpg - Liverpool 1 Aston Villa 0
- scene_216.jpg - Liverpool 2 Aston Villa 0
- scene_277.jpg - Burnley 0 Arsenal 1
- scene_393.jpg - Forest 2 Man Utd 2
- scene_486.jpg - Fulham 2 Wolves 0
- scene_612.jpg - Spurs 0 Chelsea 1
- scene_709.jpg - Palace 0 Brentford 0

**Notes for OCR:**
- Lower quality than formation graphics (often motion-blurred)
- May be partially obscured by on-screen graphics or player overlays
- Use as secondary source if formation graphics not available
- OCR region should be [specific coordinates/area]

---

### 9. Studio Segments
**Visual characteristics:**
- **Layout:** Wide-angle shot of presenters at desk with pundits
- **Colour palette:** Darker background, BBC Sport branding visible
- **Additional elements:** Often flanked by graphics showing key players from previous match
- **Typical presenters:** Rotating hosts (Gabby Logan, Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman) with pundits

**When they appear:**
- Between matches (post-match analysis)
- At episode intro (brief, after main intro sequence)
- At episode outro (league table review)
- **Typical duration:** 2-5 minutes per segment

**Auto-extracted frames showing studio:**
- scene_234.jpg - Match 1 post-analysis transition (wide studio view)
- scene_320.jpg - Match 2 post-analysis transition
- scene_419.jpg - Match 3 post-analysis transition
- scene_517.jpg - Match 4 post-analysis transition
- scene_630.jpg - Match 5 post-analysis transition
- scene_690.jpg - Match 6 post-analysis transition
- scene_770.jpg - Match 7 post-analysis transition

**Notes for OCR:**
- NO team graphics visible in typical frames (skip these for OCR)
- Identify studio segments via **process of elimination** (simpler than explicit visual detection):
  - After filtering: intro, highlights (scoreboards/FT graphics), interviews, outro
  - Remaining scenes = studio segments
- Could filter out before OCR to save processing time (~100 scenes, 12% reduction)

### 10. Transition Patterns
**How MOTD transitions between segments:**

This is the most regular transition used. "SECOND HALF" text is superimposed on top to indicate the teams swapping ends and the second half starting.

**Auto-extracted frames**
- scene_222.jpg
- scene_250.jpg
- scene_251.jpg
- scene_313.jpg
- scene_314.jpg
- scene_333.jpg
- scene_404.jpg
- scene_405.jpg
- scene_406.jpg
- scene_440.jpg
- scene_441.jpg
- scene_442.jpg
- scene_502.jpg
- scene_503.jpg
- scene_504.jpg
- scene_651.jpg
- scene_686.jpg
- scene_687.jpg
- scene_702.jpg
- scene_703.jpg
- scene_750.jpg
- scene_751.jpg

**Manual screenshot**
- docs/screenshots/transition_graphics.png

**Interviews -> Studio:**

There doesn't seem to be a transition animation used here. We normally get a zoomed out view of the hosts and pundits in the studio, flanked/accompanied by graphics of a couple of key players who featured in the game.

**Auto-extracted frames**

- Match 1: scene_234.jpg
- Match 2: scene_320.jpg
- Match 3: scene_419.jpg
- Match 4: scene_517.jpg
- Match 5: scene_630.jpg
- Match 6: scene_690.jpg
- Match 7: scene_770.jpg

**VAR During highlights**

This shouldn't be identified as a transition per se as it'll still be the same game, but here are some examples.

**Auto-extracted frames**

- scene_451.jpg
- scene_452.jpg
- scene_453.jpg
- scene_454.jpg
- scene_455.jpg
- scene_456.jpg
- scene_457.jpg
- scene_458.jpg

**Match Highlights Internal Structure:**
1. [e.g., Team walkout with formation graphic]
2. [e.g., Kickoff]
3. [e.g., Match action with scoreboard]
4. [e.g., Goals/key moments]
5. [e.g., Full-time whistle]

**Notes for OCR:**
- Transitions help identify segment boundaries
- Formation graphics typically appear at [specific point in match sequence]
- Can use transition detection to find formation graphics more efficiently

## OCR Implementation Recommendations

### Multi-Tiered OCR Strategy

**Tier 1: Full-Time Score Graphics (Primary - Most Reliable)**
- **Target frames:**
  - scene_219.jpg, scene_220.jpg, scene_221.jpg (Match 1: Liverpool vs Aston Villa)
  - scene_312.jpg (Match 2: Burnley vs Arsenal)
  - scene_401.jpg (Match 4: Fulham vs Wolves)
  - Plus manual screenshots for Matches 3, 5, 6, 7
- **Recommended OCR region:** Lower-middle of frame (yellow/white gradient background)
- **Expected accuracy:** 90-95% (clear team names, well-captured)
- **Coverage:** 5 auto-captured + 5 manual screenshots = good coverage across all 7 matches

**Tier 2: Scoreboard Graphics (Secondary - Broad Coverage)**
- **Target frames:** scene_154, 175, 216 (Match 1), scene_277 (Match 2), scene_393 (Match 3), scene_486 (Match 4), scene_612 (Match 5), scene_709 (Match 7)
- **Recommended OCR region:** Top-left corner (adaptive colours based on team kits)
- **Expected accuracy:** 75-85% (motion blur, partial obscuring during play)
- **Coverage:** All 7 matches represented
- **Use case:** Backup for matches not found via full-time scores

**Tier 3: Formation Graphics (Validation Only)**
- **Target frames:** Manual screenshots only (auto-extraction failed to capture consistently)
  - Whole-screen: Liverpool, Aston Villa (Match 1)
  - Bottom-screen: Forest, Man Utd, Fulham, Spurs, Chelsea, Brighton (partial), etc.
- **Recommended OCR region:** Bottom third for lower-screen formations, full-screen for Match 1
- **Expected accuracy:** >95% (highest quality, but manual process)
- **Use case:** Ground truth validation for tuning Tier 1 & 2 accuracy

### Scene Filtering Strategy

Based on this reconnaissance, filter 810 scenes to ~160-240 relevant scenes:

1. **Skip intro:** scenes 1-125 (first 50 seconds) = **125 scenes removed** (~15%)
   - TODO Task 010: Replace with MOTD theme music detection

2. **Skip MOTD 2 interlude:** scenes ~580-600 (52:01-52:47) = **20 scenes removed** (~2-3%)

3. **Skip short transitions:** scenes with duration <2 seconds = **~200 scenes removed** (~25%)
   - Examples: scene_194-195 (second half indicators), scene_222, 250-251, etc.

4. **Skip studio segments:** Identify via process of elimination = **~100 scenes removed** (~12%)
   - After filtering intro, highlights (scoreboards/FT graphics), interviews, outro
   - Remaining scenes = studio (no OCR needed)

5. **Skip interview segments:** Scenes with single-speaker graphics = **~50 scenes removed** (~6%)
   - Examples: scene_228-229, 233, 316, 407, 506, 627

6. **Keep for OCR:** Highlight scenes with scoreboards/FT graphics = **~160-240 scenes** (~20-30%)

**Estimated OCR workload:** 160-240 scenes (vs 810 original) = **70-80% reduction**

### Implementation Notes

- **Primary targets:** Full-time score graphics (most reliable auto-captured)
- **Backup:** Scoreboard graphics throughout highlights (ubiquitous but lower quality)
- **Validation:** Manual formation screenshots (ground truth for accuracy tuning)
- **Multi-modal future:** Task 010-011 will add audio clues (music, commentary, crowd) for better segment classification

## Manual Annotations (Optional)

If any critical patterns aren't captured in auto-extracted frames, add manual screenshots below:

### [Pattern Name]
![Manual screenshot](path/to/manual/screenshot.png)
- **Timestamp:** XX:XX:XX
- **Description:** [what this shows]
- **Why needed:** [why auto-extracted frames didn't capture this]

## Questions for OCR Implementation

After completing this reconnaissance, here are answers to guide 009b-009g implementation:

1. **Should we skip the intro entirely?** YES (for now via timecode, audio detection later)
   - Skip first 50 seconds (hardcoded for Task 009)
   - TODO Task 010: Replace with MOTD theme music detection for robustness
   - Rationale: Intro is consistent ~50 seconds, but audio detection via theme music is more reliable long-term

2. **What's the best frame type for OCR?** Multi-tiered approach (FT scores primary, scoreboards backup, formations validation)
   - **Primary:** Full-time score graphics (most reliable auto-captured, 5 scenes + 5 manual screenshots)
   - **Secondary:** Scoreboard graphics during highlights (all 7 matches covered, but motion-blurred)
   - **Validation:** Manual formation screenshots (ground truth for all 14 teams)
   - Justification: Formation graphics weren't consistently auto-captured (major gap discovered). Full-time scores are next-best option with excellent coverage and clear team names.

3. **Can we identify studio segments visually?** YES (via process of elimination)
   - Method: Identify intro (timecode), highlights (scoreboards/FT graphics), interviews (single-speaker graphics), outro (end credits)
   - Remaining scenes after filtering above = studio segments (skip for OCR)
   - Rationale: Simpler than explicit visual detection, less prone to false positives

4. **Estimated % of 810 frames that are useful for OCR:** ~20-30% (160-240 scenes)
   - Filtering strategy:
     - Skip intro: 125 scenes (15%)
     - Skip MOTD 2 interlude: 20 scenes (2-3%)
     - Skip short transitions (<2 sec): 200 scenes (25%)
     - Skip studio (via elimination): 100 scenes (12%)
     - Skip interviews: 50 scenes (6%)
     - **Target for OCR:** 160-240 scenes with scoreboards/FT graphics (20-30%)
   - **70-80% reduction in processing load**

5. **Any unexpected patterns discovered:**
   - ❌ **Formation graphics NOT consistently auto-captured** (critical gap - only 3-4 of 7 matches)
   - ✅ **Full-time score graphics better than expected** (well-captured, clear team names)
   - 📐 **MOTD structure is highly formulaic** (predictable pattern per match)
   - 🎵 **Audio clues could improve classification** (music, commentary, crowd - for Task 010+)
   - 📝 **Scoreboards use full team names** (not codes): "Liverpool", "Man Utd", "Forest" (helpful for matching)
   - 📺 **MOTD 2 interlude mid-episode** (52:01-52:47 needs explicit filtering)
   - 🎬 **Running order != fixture date order** (editorial choice - biggest match first)
